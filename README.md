"The Subtract a Square game is a strategic two-player mathematical game. You can either enter the starting number of coins or allow the computer to choose for you. The game begins with Player 1, who must enter a square number (4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc.). The chosen square number is then subtracted from the starting number of coins.

Next, it's Player 2's turn. Player 2 must also select a square number, taking into consideration the remaining number of coins. The game continues with players alternately choosing square numbers and subtracting them from the remaining coins.

The player who removes the last remaining coin is declared the winner."
